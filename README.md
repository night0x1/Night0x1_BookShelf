# Night0x1_BookShelf Database Project

# Objective
I am undertaking a comprehensive database project named Night0x1_BookShelf to catalog my
personal book collection. This project is inspired by Anthony DeBarros "Practical SQL" 
and aims to systematically organize and manage detailed information about each book in my collection.

$ Scope:
The database will initially focus on organizng essential details such as genre, author, title, and
publication date for each book. As I progress though the project, I will incorporate additional
functionalities and features based on the insights and knowledge gained from "Practical SQL".

# Methodology:

  1. Database Creation:
       -  Create a uniquely named database to house the book collection
       -  Establish a foundational table dedicated to genres, which will include essential
          book details such as titles, authors, and publication dates.     
  2.  Database Expanasion:
      -  As I advance through the learning material, I will continously enhance
         the database structure and capabilites
      -  Implement advanced SQL techniques and best practices to optimize database
         performance and functionality.
  3.  Practical Application:
      -  Apply theoretical knowledge from "Practical SQL" to real-world scenarios within the
         database project.
      -  Experiment with various SQL queries, indexing strategies, and normalization techniques to
         ensure data integrity and efficiency.

# Goals:
      -  Enhance my practical SQL skills through hands-on experience
      -  Develop a robust and efficent system fro managing and exploring my personal literary
         collection.
      -  Create a scalable and adaptable database structure that can accomodate future expansions
         and improvements.
