# Night0x1_BookShelf

I am undertaking a database project to catalog my personal book collection, inspired by the insights gained from Anthony DeBarros' "Practical SQL". The database will systematically organize information about each book, including genre, author, title, and publication date. As I advance through the project, I intend to incorporate newly acquired knowledge from the book into the database design and management.

The initial phase involves creating a uniquely named database. It will feature a table dedicated to genres, encompassing essential details such as book titles, authors, and publication dates. Subsequently, I plan to expand the database's capabilities based on the progressive learning journey facilitated by "Practical SQL".

This project not only serves to enhance my practical SQL skills but also aims to provide an efficient system for managing and exploring my personal literary collection.

This version maintains a professional tone while clearly outlining the purpose, scope, and methodology of your database project. It emphasizes your learning process and the practical application of SQL concepts, which adds depth and relevance to your endeavor.
