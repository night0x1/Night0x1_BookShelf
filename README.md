# Night0x1_BookShelf

For my project I will be creating a database that holds all the books I have 
stored in my bookshelf. This database will contain information about the genere,
author, title of the books, and the amount of books a author has in my bookshelf.
Reading the book "Practical Sql" By Anthony DeBarros was what motivated me to 
create a database project on the books I have stored in my shelf.

To start off the project I will be creating a database with a unique name.
It will have a table for the type of genere that are in the database which 
contain columns of the title, author, and day it was published. As I progress
in through the book I will add new things that I learned from the book.
